# 5590_FacialRecognition
COMP5590-Sr.Project Facial Recognition System
These Python scripts allow for multiple images of an individual to be captured, 
and a Machine Learning model created using Open Computer Vision (OpenCV).
Once the model has been created, images can be tested for prediction accuracy.
My application revolved around digital video surveillance avoidance, with both
analog and digital techniques used to avoid facial recognition.
